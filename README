Instantly browse a Git repository in CGit
=========================================

This is git-instaweb for people who prefer CGit.


Requirements
============

- Python 2.6 or later
- Git
- CGit


Installation
============

Just copy "git-instacgit" into your path - no fancy setup scripts here!

You then need to tell git-instacgit where to find your CGit installation:

    git config --global instacgit.script /path/to/cgit
    git config --global instacgit.datadir /path/to/datadir/

"instacgit.script" points to the CGit binary.

"instacgit.datadir" points to the directory containing the CGit resource
files, "cgit.css" and "cgit.png".


Running
=======

Type "git instacgit" inside a Git repository.


Configuration
=============

"git instacgit" is configured through "git config".  In addition to the
"instacgit.script" and "instacgit.datadir" described above, keys of the form
"instacgit.config.*" are also recognized.  These are used to configure CGit in
addition to the default configuration.

For example, if you want to turn off the commit graph:

    git config instacgit.config.enable-commit-graph 0
